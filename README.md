# Paradux: a scheme to recover from maximum personal data disaster

This repo implements Paradux, the data recovery scheme outlined
[in this blog post](https://upon2020.com/blog/2019/01/paradux-a-scheme-to-recover-from-maximum-personal-data-disaster/).

Status: about the first version that does something useful, on the way to
[plan for V1](docs/v1-plan.md).

[Installation instructions](docs/install.md). Note that paradux depends on
`cryptsetup` and thus only works on Linux.
