# Paradux: a scheme to recover from maximum personal data disaster

This repo is intended for code that implements Paradux, the data
recovery scheme outlined
[here](https://upon2020.com/blog/2019/01/paradux-a-scheme-to-recover-from-maximum-personal-data-disaster/).

So far, there is basically no code yet. At least it doesn't do anything
useful yet.

But we have a [plan for V1](docs/v1-plan.md). And
[installation instructions](docs/install.md) for the code that doesn't
really do anything useful yet.

Want to help? Get in touch! My contact info is in the commit log.
