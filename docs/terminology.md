Terminology
===========

* "Paradux User": the individual who operates Paradux for a certain set
  of valuable data, such as their own personal data, or the personal data of
  all members of their family.

* "Paradux Metadata": all data maintained by the Paradux User's Paradux
  installation.

* "Dataset X": A set of valuable personal data, consisting of at least
  one Data Location. (Hopefully, more than one, because if there is only
  one Data Location in a Dataset, it cannot be recovered if it is
  lost)

* "User Dataset X Source": The copy of User Dataset X that is in the location
  where it is typically used. Example: the user's home directory on a laptop.

* "User Dataset X Destination": one of the backup copies of User Dataset X.

* "Paradux Steward": an individual who has agreed to perform certain actions
  to help the Paradux User recover.

* "Everyday Passphrase": Used to access the Paradux Metadata
  by the Paradux User on a day-to-day basis. The Everyday Passphrase
  should only exist in the head of the Paradux User, and never be
  written down.

* "Recovery Secret": the private key used to recover the Paradux Metadata
  if the Everyday Password is lost. The Recovery Secret is split into
  several Recovery Secret Fragments, one of which is distributed to each
  Paradux Steward in a Paradux Steward Package.

* "Paradux Steward Package": contains all data and documentation needed
  for a (forgetful) Paradux Steward to perform their tasks under the
  Paradux scheme.
