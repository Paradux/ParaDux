Installation instructions
=========================

Requirements
------------

* Python 3

* PIP

Installation
------------

* Check out the code: `git clone https://github.com/paradux/paradux.git`

* Go to the checked-out directory: `cd paradux`

* Run `pip install .` This requires you to have access to write to the
  install directories, so perhaps you need to invoke it as `sudo pip install .`

* Then you are can run it with `python bin/paradux` or you can install
  `bin/paradux` somewhere suitable in your `$PATH`.
